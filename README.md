Maddie's Astronomy Program

What problem does it solve?
It makes NASA imagery / the picture of the day and the Mars Rover images easier for the common person to access and explore.

Who has this problem?
The average person interested in astronomy.

Technologies used.
HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Materialize, Owl Carousel, NASA APIs, Wikipedia APIs

Customer Feedback.
Many helped with design ideas like the background, the shadow-text, the buttons and other. Some suggested using a date picker, which I tried but discarded as it did not work very well.

My biggest challenge.
This was probably figuring out the API in the beginning with NASA. I also took some time with the Wikipedia API and figuring out how to convert the links. Cleaning up the code took some time as well, trying to make the cleanup functions more reusable.
Mobile responsiveness took awhile to figure out, especially with the finickiness of Materialize. Also getting my divs to align correctly for mobile was tricky as they were switched from normal orientation.
